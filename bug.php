In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with references and objects, specifically when modifying objects passed by reference within functions.  Consider this example:

```php
class MyClass {
    public $value = 0;
}

function modifyObject(MyClass &$obj) {
    $obj = new MyClass(); // Creates a NEW object, reassigning the reference
    $obj->value = 10;
}

$myObject = new MyClass();
echo $myObject->value; // Outputs 0

modifyObject($myObject);
echo $myObject->value; // Still outputs 0, unexpectedly!
```

The issue is that within `modifyObject`, the line `$obj = new MyClass();` does *not* modify the original `$myObject`. Instead, it creates a *new* `MyClass` object and reassigns the *reference* `$obj` to point to this new object. The original `$myObject` remains unchanged.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and hard-to-debug issues if developers assume that modifications within the function affect the original object.
